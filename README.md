# Automated Pin Assignment Tool in C++

* Developed an inter-chip pin assignment tool for VLSI designs, in C++ using the OpenAccess API.

* Created a new algorithm that improved by 6% the wirelength of the initial placement. 

Our average runtime was less than 1s for thegiven benchmarks, which was one of the fastest among the class
